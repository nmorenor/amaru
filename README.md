# Amaru: The Sea Rescue Mission

Welcome to "Amaru," our entry for the [Ebiten Game Jam 2023](https://itch.io/jam/ebitengine-game-jam-2023). This year's theme is "Reverse," and we've designed a game that allows you to reverse the pollution in our world's oceans.

In "Amaru," you take on the role of the captain of a dragon vessel. Your mission is to rid the sea of waste and rescue the trapped marine animals. This casual mini-game is primarily designed for multiplayer fun and promotes environmental awareness.

## Gameplay
In multiplayer mode, "Amaru" operates on a Host and Join model. The Host creates the session and essentially 'owns' it. This implies that if the host ends the session, it results in all other players exiting the session too.

Hosting a Session: To host, simply provide your name, which will also serve as the session name.

Joining a Session: To join an existing session, provide your name and select the desired session from a list.

Collect waste to earn points - one point per waste item. Saving an animal earns you two points. But beware! Colliding with another player results in a loss of two points for each player.

"Amaru" features game rounds of 30 seconds, followed by a 15-second break where you can chat with other players.

## Scoring System

- Each waste item collected: +1 point
- Each animal rescued: +2 points
- Collision with another player: -2 points
